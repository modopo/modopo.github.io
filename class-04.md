# Reading Class 04

Learn HTML

1) To create a basic link in HTML, the `<a>` tag defines a link. The attribute `href` will indicate the link's destination.

2) The `href` attribute in a link tag will contain the destination of the link.

3) In the case of screen readers for accessability, link test should be kept short. It is not best practice to use the actual path as the link text as well. Avoiding the word "links" will also be helpful, as well as avoiding the same link text across all other links.

Learn CSS

1) Normal flow is defined as the flow of elements rendered on a page without any changes made by any external influence to their normal layout.

2) Block level element will span across any available space of the parent element containing the block level element. Essentially, the block level element grows and fills up to the block's dimension, regardless of the content size. With inline elements, the element will only span to the size of the content, regardless of the parent element's dimension. Inline elements will not fill up to the parent's element dimension.

3) Static  positioning is the default for every HTML element.

4) When using absolute positioning, the element no longer follows the normal flow. The element will exist on a separate layer, and will not be influenced by any other element aside from the ancestor element. When adjusting the positioning with top, bottom, right and left of an element with absolute positioning, the distance is specified and adjusted from the ancestor containing element.

5) Fixed positioning is anchored to the viewport (the visible portion when viewing a page), where as absolute positioning is anchored to the ancestor element.

Learn JS

1) A function declaration defines a set of instruction that performs a task. Invoking a function actually runs the function to perform the task.

2) A parameter is a named variable passed into a function (aliases for the value), while arugments are actual values being passed in.

Miscellaneous

1) Two benefits for pair programming would be work environment readiness and engaged collaborations. The work envirnonment readiness is important because there are definitely disagreements in many aspect while coding, whether it be methodology or implementations, the team needs to convene to a point to make progress to the goal/deadline. While negotaiting between differences, it will engage collaborations because there might be discovery made that unite the pair to find a solution for the current issue they're running into.

## Things I want to know more about

CSS has been the weakest portion of the full stack for me. I have been primarily studying JS, so design in HTML and CSS have been quite lacking for me.
