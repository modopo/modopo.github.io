AWS EC2

1) EC2 stands for Elastic Compute Cloud. EC2 instacnes provides computing capacity in the cloud that can scale to the demand.

2) Hosting web application and processing Big Data. For web apps, EC2 will allow for software installation required and launch with the right resource. For data processing, high CPU capacity with high memory capcity instance can process large amount of data.

3) ECS provides more control and flexibility over infrastructure and the deployment process.

EC2 for Humans

1) A quick search for EC2, or the compute section.

2) XL has a lot more computer power.

3) A compute cycle is a way to measure how much computing power you're using. For example, with Amazon EC2 instances, a compute cycle is like a "virtual CPU" running at full power for one hour. So if you have an EC2 instance running for an hour, that's one compute cycle.

Elastic Beanstalk

1) Elastic Beanstalk makes it easy to deploy and manage web applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.

2) Amazon Elastic Beanstalk is a platform as a service (PaaS) that runs on top of Amazon EC2, a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.

3) Simplified deployment, scalability, multi-platform support
