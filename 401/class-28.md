useEffect Hook

1) The main intended use case for the useEffect hook in React is to handle side effects, such as fetching data from an external API, subscribing to events, or manipulating the DOM.

2) The effect's logic in the useEffect hook interacts with the component by allowing it to perform side effects after every render or when certain dependencies change. The effect's logic is an integral part of the component and can interact with the component's state, props, and lifecycle methods to perform side effects and handle other functionality.

3) The return value from the effect's logic function in the useEffect hook is important because it allows for the cleanup of any resources used by the effect and can be used to optimize the performance of the component.
