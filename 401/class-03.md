ES6 Classes

1) Objects in JS.

2) No. They need to be initialized first.

Express Routing

1) Routing refers to the endpoint the application uses to respond to request from the client.

2) Route method is the type of request made, while route path is the actual path to the endpoint to make the request.

3) next is added to a route handler whenthe request needs to be passed off to another callback function or middleware. If next is passed to the middleware as a paramenter, it must be called/invoked.

Express Routing

1) Express router is the routing components of the Express.js. The routes can spread across different modules if there are multiple instances of Express Router, which makes the code flexible to build.

2) An instances of Express Router is created. All routes required can be applied to this router, and the app can use this router.

3) Route middleware is used to check or transform the request data before it is sent back as a response.
