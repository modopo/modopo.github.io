# Growth Mindset #

- A growth minset is the belief that when faced with failure, rather than give up an individual uses failure as a tool to improve their understanding. It is the belief that through hard work and persevierence even the most daunting tasks can be made manageable. Inteligence is not a static trait, but one that can be improved upon through hard work


# Emotional Intelligence #

- It is important to have emotional intelligence because it allows for safe and comfortable interactions with individuals in a team. It allows you to be aware of cues that people may be uncomfortable or need some support even if they may not be able to vocalize it 

- One thing I've improved in with my emotional intelligence is being able to reflect and decide how to approach the issue

## Biases ##

- I've become more aware of the fact that even if I have different opinions than an individual it doesn't mean I can't get along with them. Their entire personality doesn't boil down to a few opinions.
