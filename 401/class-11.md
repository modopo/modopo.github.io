Event Driven Programming

1) The events module provides an EventEmitter class that can be used to handle and emit events in a Node.js application.

2) OOP provides a way to encapsulate related data and behavior into objects, making code more modular and reusable. When used in tandem with Event Driven Programming, OOP can help to organize event handling code into discrete objects that can be more easily maintained and extended since there is a single source of truth to reference from, instead of each individual object.

3) in the backend of a web application, there are certain actions that need to be taken when specific events occur. For example, when a user submits a form, the application needs to save that data to a database. This is where Node.js comes in - it allows developers to write event-driven code that responds to different events in the application. Using Node.js, developers can create event listeners that "listen" for specific events to occur in the application. When those events occur, the code responds accordingly - for example, by saving data to a database, sending an email, or performing some other action.
