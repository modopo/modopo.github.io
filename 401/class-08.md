5 steps to RBAC

1) Role Based Access Control (RBAC) is a security model that restricts system access based on the roles and responsibilities of individual users. RBAC ensures that users have access to only the information and resources necessary to perform their jobs, reducing the risk of unauthorized access or data breaches.

2) In a banking system, RBAC might involve roles such as "Teller," "Bank Manager," and "Loan Officer." Tellers might have permissions to deposit and withdraw funds, while Loan Officers might have permissions to approve or deny loan applications. Bank Managers would have access to more sensitive information such as customer account details and financial data.

3) To implement RBAC, first identify the roles and responsibilities of each user in the system and define the permissions associated with each role. Then assign users to the appropriate roles and ensure that access controls are in place to restrict access to unauthorized users.

1) Authorization answers the question "what are you allowed to do now that we know who you are?"

2) Role assignment, Role authorization and Permission authorization

3) RBAC is a security model that helps ensure that the right people have access to the right information and resources in a system. With RBAC, users are assigned roles based on their job responsibilities, and each role has a set of permissions that dictate what actions they can perform in the system. This helps reduce the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access, making the system more secure and easier to manage.

RBAC tutorial

1) Access rights are associated with the role, not the user in RBAC. Users are assigned to roles based on their job responsibilities, and each role has a set of permissions that dictate what actions the user can perform within the system.

2) Access Rights or Authorization is activated after a user successfully authenticates or verifies their identity using some form of authentication mechanism such as a username and password

3) RBAC can benefit a business by reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive information, while also simplifying access control through a structured approach that assigns roles and permissions based on job responsibilities.
