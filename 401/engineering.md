# Engineering Readings

1) The one thing I can bring to this career is the ability to deep dive into the root issue of the problem. After working in a large corporation, there's noone holding your hands to solve your own problem, and you really need to understand the root issue in order to address it.

2) The three things I'll implement: a) Identifying the root issue first, instead of generalizing the issue. b) Asking precise questions that are not something that can be easily tested or researched. c) Walking away for a little bit if nothing else can be pursued.
