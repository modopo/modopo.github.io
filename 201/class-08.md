Learn CSS - Flexbox

1) Flexbox is designed for one dimensional content. Being one-dimensional, flexbox will deal with the layout in a single direction at a time, whether it be rows or columns.

2) Main axis is the axis the one set by the property `flex-direction`. The cross axis is the other direction to the main axis, so if main axis is rows, the cross axis is the column direction.

3) Properties that reorder the visual display away from the HTML document will create discrepancies between the logical order versus what is seen. Screen readers will read the logical order and will not follow what is displayed. Navigating with the keyboard will also follow the logical order.

CSS Layout - Flexbox

1) Flexbox is responsive and mobile friendly. The flexbox container does not collapse with the margin of the content, and we can change the order of the elements without editing the HTML.

2) This topic connects to my long term goal through layout design. I've been struggling to get my layouts to not deform when adding columns through  grid layout.
