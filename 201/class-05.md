# Reading Class 05

HTML media

1) The `alt` attribute is a alternative text that is to describe the image. It is useful for accessability such as screen readers. It also display the text if the image itself is unavailable, or if it takes too long ot render.

2) Simple text alternatives for images are helpful. They aid with screen readers to pick up and read to users.

3) In the case of screen readers for accessability, link test should be kept short. It is not best practice to use the actual path as the link text as well. Avoiding the word "links" will also be helpful, as well as avoiding the same link text across all other links.

4) The `<figure>` tag is used to semantically link an image to it's respective caption.

5) An svg image is an image  drawn with very precise lines at different sizes. An gif is an image that actually animates when displayed.

6) The lossless format is recommended for screenshots because text might be appear pixalated or fuzzy if the quality of the image is too low when displayed.

1) Foreground colors (colors which are before background colors) are the colors you see on the screen before the background colors. The foreground color would color the HTML element's content, and the background color is the color of the background of the HTML element.

2) Text, boxes and borders can have colors. In the instance of text, the text itself can have color and the backgorund of the text and be colored. Boxes that contain content can have color in the background, and the borders around the boxes can have color as well.

3) Font availability is one consideration when choosing fonts. Not all fonts are available to every single user out in the open.

4) `font-size`dictates the size of the text. `font-weight` sets how bold the text will look. `font-style`is used to toggle italic.

5) `letter-spacing` and `word-spacing` attributes can be used to change the spacing between characters or words respectively.
