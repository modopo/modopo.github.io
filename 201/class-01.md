2) HTML is pasred first, which then in turns let the browers know if there are any links that reference any external CSS styleshseets and any scripts elements referencing to scripts. As the HTML is being parsed by the browser, any CSS files and JavaScript files are requested from the server.

3) To add an image to HTML, the img tag is used, with the src attributed, which contains the path to an image file, wether it be an URL or a local file.

4) You create a variable with a declaration `let` and a variable name. To create a String, you assigned literal string to the newly created varialbe, and vice versa for Numbers. You assign a number to the variable.
