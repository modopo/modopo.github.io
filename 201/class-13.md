Local Storage and How to Use on Websites

1) Local storage can be used to store a state of the interface. The state can be reloaded when the same user visists the page and still have data from the last session that is relelvant to the user.

2) Passwords or sensitive data should not be stored locally as any JavaScript can access local storage.

3) Local storage can only store string. The string could then be serialize by using JSON methods like `stringify()` and `parse()` which will recreate the object as it goes through the string.

JSON methods seem powerful. I would like to see what we can do with JSON methods.
