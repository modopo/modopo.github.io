API Design Best Practices

1) REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer

2) REST APIs are designed around resources, which are any kind of object/data/service that can be accessed by the client.

3) The resource has an identifier, which is a URI (uniform resource identifier) that identifies that resource. A set of random numbers assigned to a resource would work.

4) GET, POST, PUT, PATCH

5) A URI should be based on nouns.

6) Orders, Supplies, or Models

7) A chatty web API exposes a large number of small resource, which may require a client application to send multiple requests to find all the data that it requires.

8) 200

9) 404 for not found, or 204 for no content.

10) 201

11) 200 with no new resource, or 204 for no content, or 400 for bad requests.

I would like to see firsthand a chatty web API.
