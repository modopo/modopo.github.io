nosql vs sql

1) 
| SQL           | NoSQL           |
| -------       | -------         |
| table based DB | document based, key-value pairs, graph DB or wide-column stores |
| predefined schema | dynamic schema for unstructured data | 
| vertical scalable by increasing hardware computing power | horizontally scalable by increasing hardward count |
| structured query language (SQL) | Unstructured query language (UnQL) |
| good for complex query | not good fit for complex query |

2) SQL is good for high transactional based, non-hierarchical data.

3) Data that has been put in data, such as employee data and their performance, where aggregations can be done.

4) NoSQL is good for hierarchical data storage, similarily to JSON formatted data. It's good for Big Data.

5) Data that invovles the concept of Objects work well.

6) NoSQL

7) SQL

sql vs nosql

1) Structured Query Language

2) Relational database are databases that can reference and provided data to other databases since the data is related.

3) Relational database work with tables in column and row formats.

4) Schema is the list of logical structures of data for the table, like a standarized header across tables.

5) NoSQL database is a non-tabular database that store data differently than relational tables.

6) No schema is needed, and document are stored instead of tables. The data is essentially a collection of data that's all related data in a single collection.

7) MongoDB database has a database that consists of collecdtions, which contains documents.

8) MongoDB is more flexible because schema isn't enforced, and relations don't necessary need to be defined. You can query directly the data you need, versus trying to query the relation first to join the data to what you need.

9) NoSQL disadvantage is primarily the lack of standarization. The data is stored however it is needed and there's no enforcement of consistency in the database.
