CRUD Basics

1) A PUT request is needed to update the record through an API.

2) The DELETE request needs an id to know which data to delete.

Building a CRUD API

1) CRUD is manipulating data around in the DB and describing the function of the app, while REST is controlling the data through HTTP commands.

2) Set routes to handle GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. Connect to a database. Create functions that request or change the data in the DB. Send response back from the API requests. Handle any errors that arise.
