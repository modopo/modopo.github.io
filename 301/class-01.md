# Reading Class 01

Component-Based Architecture

1) A component is a software object that's clearly defined, portable, replacable, modular and resuable set of functionality that encapsulates it's implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface. Its purpose is to interact with other components.

2) Reusable - designed to be reused in different applications. Replacable - may be freely substituted for another component. Not Context Specific - designed to operate in various environment and context. Extensible - can be extended from another existing component to provide new behaviour. Encapsulated - no inner workings or values are exposed when inovking its functionality. Independent - designed to have minimal dependicies from other components.

3) Ease of deployment, reduced cost, ease of development, reusuable, modifiable, reliable, maintainability, and independant.

What is Props and How to Use it in React

1) "Props" is shorthand for properties, an object that passed data between components uni-directionally.

2) Props are objects that pass data between components uni-directionally as read-only.

3) Parents to child and further down as many times as needed. It is never passed up from the child.

## Things I want to know more about

Watching the demo on how props were passed down to the grand-children was a little fragmented. I wasn't able to fully visulize how it was passed beyond the child.
